OVERVIEW:-
This repository contains a Python project that analyzes IMDb movie data using powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn. 
The project provides various insights into movie data, including filtering, grouping, and statistical analysis, along with visual representations of the findings.




Based on my analysis of the IMDb movie data, several intriguing insights were uncovered. 
I first cleaned the data using pandas to ensure accuracy and consistency. 
The dataset reveals a robust filtering capability, allowing me to identify movies released after 2020. 
I calculated the average runtime of all movies and grouped them by year to highlight trends in popularity. 
Interestingly, I found movies that span multiple genres, showcasing diverse storytelling approaches. 
One of the standout findings was the identification of the most profitable movie.
From a financial perspective, I computed the average budget of the movies and identified which ones had revenue greater than this average. 
I also counted movies by language, pinpointed the longest runtime movie, and calculated the percentage of movies in each status.
For data visualization, I created various charts and plots to present the findings effectively. 
A bar chart illustrated the movie count by language, while a pie chart showed the distribution of movie status. 
A histogram depicted the budget distribution, and a correlation heatmap explored relationships between different variables. 
Finally, a scatter plot of budget versus revenue highlighted the balance between investment and returns. 
These visualizations enhance understanding and facilitate an interactive exploration of the data.
